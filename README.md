## Hello!

Welcome to Viz Data, data visualization @ https://ancient-reaches-44992.herokuapp.com. This is a website that let any registered user customize graphs and analyze job market trends using data we pulled from authenticjobs.com's API (Application Programming Interface), or like their database. 

## How it works?

When user first navigate to the website, they will be first introduced with a splash page and info boxes below that explain what we do and what each job title might be about. Upon registering or loggin after clicking links on the top right corner, users will be given the ability to create graph by clicking the 'Graph' link.

In the graph's create page, user can choose the types of job categories they want narrow down, which then are grouped by the company cities, company countries, or by the week of which jobs are posted. Lastly, they can customize how their data is displayed by changing the graph type. Hitting 'create' will then bring user to the graph's show page.

The graph is displayed as customized, with corresponding labels and legends next to the graph. The length or segment of chart is aggregated by counts.
